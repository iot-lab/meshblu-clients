This is the Meshblu clients sample repository

Installing
----------

To run these sample clients, install the required libs
e.g. in a dedicated python virtual env:

	mkvirtualenv py
	pip install -r requirements.txt


You will need a running instance of Meshblu.
Either use the production instance at `data.embers.city`,
or install and run your own local instance.

To install and run a local instance of Meshblu,
